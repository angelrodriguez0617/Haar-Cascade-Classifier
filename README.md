# Haar-Cascade-Classifier
A Haar cascade classifier is a machine learning-based object detection program that identifies objects in an image or video. The works involve identifying wind turbines for the purpose of inspection by an autonomous drone (funded by USHE grant) using Python scripts. The datasets are not included as they are to be disclosed during the course of research and development.
